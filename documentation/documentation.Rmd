## Aim
The aim of BMI application is to calculate your Body Mass Index and show your current position related to a dataset included at mixsmsn R package. Data colection has BMI data from 2107 people.

Further information about mixsmsn package:

## What is the Body Mass Index?
The body mass index (BMI), or Quetelet index, is a measure of relative size based on the mass and height of an individual.

The index was devised by Adolphe Quetelet during the course of developing what he called "social physics", between 1830 and 1850.[2] The BMI for a person is defined as their body mass divided by the square of their heightâ€”with the value universally being given in units of kg/m2. So if the weight is in kilograms and the height in metres, the result is immediate, if pounds and inches are used, a conversion factor of 703 (kg/m2)/(lb/in2) must be applied.
Source: Wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Body_mass_index

   $$ \mathrm{BMI} = \frac{\text{mass}_\text{kg}}{\text{height}_\text{m}^2} = \frac{\text{mass}_\text{lb}}{\text{height}_\text{in}^2}\times 703 $$
